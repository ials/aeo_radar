### "Introduction to radar remote sensing for forest monitoring in GEE"

Johannes Reiche, Bart Slagter & Johannes Balling
23-03-2020


### Requirements
* Software
  * Google Earth Engine (GEE)
* Dataset provided via GEE
  * Sentinel-1

### Learning goals
* Introduction to GEE
* Visualisation and RGB generation of SAR images
* Understanding basic SAR backscatter characteristics (VV and VH backscatter values and distributions) over different land cover (forest, plantation, non-forest, built-up and water)
* Linking the backscatter characteristics to particular scatter mechanism on the ground (surface, volume and double bounce scattering). Understanding interactions of the radar wave with objects on the ground (tree, water ...).

### Literature
* Very useful overview of scatter mechanism over forest and water areas: Chapter “Interaction of SAR signal with water bodies” in [Thenkabail (2016): Remote Sensing of Water Resources, Disasters, and Urban Studies. CRC Press.](https://books.google.nl/books?id=Sne9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=Interaction+of+SAR+signal+with+water+bodies&source=bl&ots=ZKEgNiz87F&sig=RehZTUjv9Y4GjYxthBRS7x6EvtM&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1v87mye3LAhUEIg8KHaK_BkcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=Interaction%20of%20SAR%20signal%20with%20water%20bodies&f=false)

* A useful study to learn about SAR backscatter characteristics and basic SAR change detection over tropical forest  areas: [(Ribbes et al. 1997)](ftp://ftp.eorc.jaxa.jp/cdroms/EORC-036/pi/16floren.pdf)
